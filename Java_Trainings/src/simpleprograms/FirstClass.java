//Note: What are packages?
//Package is just a container to store the classes
//we can segregate the classes with help of packages.
//we can also overcome the issue of class name conflict by putting them inside the package

//How To create a Package: Right click on src folder
//Create a new package - provide a name in small case letter without space
//Right click on the Package name.
//Navigate to the drop-down list & click on 'Class' option to create a new - class inside that package.
//provide classname here without any space only underscore accepted
//remember to check the public static void main check box

//Best Practice: Always Create a new Project>>Move to its 'scr' folder>>Right click & Create a new Package>> Inside that package, Create a Class


public class FirstClass { // From here the ClassBody starts

	public static void main(String[] args) { // From here the Body of Main method starts and curly braces act as a token for the main method
		System.out.println("My First Java Class");

	}// Here the Body of Main method ends

} // Here the ClassBody ends
